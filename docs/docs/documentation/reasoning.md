# Reasoning Behind The Project

## Why did I create this project?

This project was created to help improve my overall development skills.

## Areas Of Focus

### Languages

#### Frontend

Interactive built with Vue

#### Backend

RESTful API built with Python + Flask

### Docker

Work on building Docker images. Have deployed many containers, but haven't built my own images a lot and deployed them to DockerHub.

### VSCode Dev Containers

Just found out about VSCode Dev containers. This is an interesting concept to me and I want to work on implementing them more.

### Git Workflows

Used Git as VCS before, never had proper commit messages and branching with semantics in mind.

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions or Jenkins)

Automatically deploy nightly and release builds.
